# Ansible-role-httpd-haproxy-aws
Ansible role for Httpd Webserver and Haproxy Load Balancer on AWS

- Create an ansible role myapache to configure Httpd WebServer. 
- Create another ansible role myloadbalancer to configure HAProxy LB. 
- We need to combine both of these roles controlling webserver versions and solving challenge for host ip's addition dynamically over each Managed Node in HAProxy.cfg file.

## Thankyou!
